Interpreter written in python for a small programming language aiming to be similar to written English.

Currently very barebones, supports:
- Variable assignment (floats, booleans, strings)
- Lists
- Conditionals
- Functions
- Mathematical operations: +, -, *, /, %, ^
- Mathematical operations over lists (i.e., [1,2] * 2 = [2,4])

WARNING: not thoroughly tested or optimized for actual use, this is just random project to see what it would look like.
